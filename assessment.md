## Essential stuff about assignments

You must familiarise yourself with the University regulations about assessment processes.  These can be found in the Faculty Handbook on Blackboard.

Most course work is required to be submitted electronically through Blackboard. 

Module handbooks should indicate where submissions are made in other ways. There are a series of principles and standards around the submission of your work that have been put in place to 
ensure equity for all students:

Your assignments must be electronically processed:
* Use your UB number and Module Title as the title of the document
* Use Arial size 12 font
* Margins set to 2.54cms
* Use A4 size paper for written work
* 1.5 line spacing and leaving a margin on the left-hand side
* Do not include your name: Using the footer function you must number your pages, and add your UB number on each page
* File names - avoid punctuation marks and spaces in file names, aim to keep the filename as short as possible
* File formats - check that you are submitting the correct file type. Most assignments will
require files to be in doc or docx types.

You should reference your sources using the Harvard referencing system. 
Please use the Faculty’s Harvard Reference Guide <a href="http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/files/course/harvard-ref/index.htm" target="_blank"> which can be accessed by clicking this link</a> 

**Word count**  
Please note there are penalties for assessed work which exceeds the specified maximum word count limit.

Example: 
Imagine you have to submit a written assignment where the maximum word limit is 2400.
Your essay is 3000 words.
You will be submitting an essay that is 25% over the limit.
The examiner will mark your work but will impose a 25% reduction to your mark.

The word limit will exclude bibliographies, reference lists, diagrams and tables, tables of
contents footnotes and appendices of data.

There is no penalty for writing less than the word limit. However, it is unlikely that you
will be able to meet the assessment criteria in substantially fewer words than the limit allowed.

**Late or work not submitted**  
It is the University policy that any work that is submitted late without an agreed extension will receive a mark of 0%.

**Pass marks and supplementary submissions**  
40% is the Pass Mark for a module.   
If you fail a module you will be given a resubmission date (called a supplementary assessment).  
You must undertake this supplementary chance.  
Failure to do so will result in you being withdrawn from the programme – even if you have passed all your other modules. 
You **may** only be offered a 3rd and final chance if you have undertaken your supplementary. 

### Academic misconduct (or how not to cheat)
 
Academic misconduct basically means cheating. Don't do it!


It is not acceptable to say that you do not know what academic misconduct is because you have never read any of the guidance.

It is your responsibility to ensure that you look at the information about plagiarism and referencing that your Faculty provides in handbooks and on Blackboard.

All new students are required to complete an online course called Plagiarism Avoidance for New Students before you submit your first assignment. This is a University regulation. The course consists of six tutorials followed by a test. You will be given a deadline by which to  complete the test. The materials and the test will be found in Blackboard in an Organisation called
Faculty of Health Studies Plagiarism Induction.
