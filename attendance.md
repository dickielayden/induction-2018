<h3>Attendance & monitoring</h3>
The University places great importance in your attendance. 

<p>Our regulations for taught programmes state:</p>
<p>
</p><i>"Student attendance is expected at all scheduled learning activities, together with satisfactory completion and submission by the due dates prescribed by the School of all assessed coursework and such other practical and written exercises as may be required by the relevant Course Regulations."  </i></p> 

<p>We want you to be here and engaging with your studies.  Sometimes there are issues that prevent you from being with us.  This Tip aims to highlight how we check your attendance and what to do if you can't attend.</p>

<h3>Direct contact students:</h3> 
<p>We operate a 'check-in' electronic registration system.  This records your attendance at teaching activities.</p>

<p>Most teaching rooms will have a card reader fixed to the wall, close to the entrance. Large teaching rooms will have more than one reader - it doesn't matter which one you use as long as it is in the room where your class is being held.</p>

<p>If you forget your card you will need to complete a paper Check-in form.  You will need to enter your student number onto this form so keep a copy of it somewhere safe. </p>

<p>If you are late to a session you must still check-in.</p>
<ul>
<li> Check your timetable on a regular basis</li>
<li> make sure you have your student card with you at all times and ready to Check-In before every class</li>
<li>If you forget your student card, you will need to record your attendance by completing a paper Check-In record in class.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Distance learning students:</h3>

<h3><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i>  Where are my timetables?</h3>

<h3><i class="fa fa-stethoscope"></i>  How do I report an absence?</h3>

**Planned absence**  
If you know you will be absent for a session (compassionate leave, maternity leave, hospital admission etc) contact your PAT.

**Unplanned absence** 
The link below will take you to the online absence form. 
Note: the form is hosted on Google Docs.  If you do not wish to use it then telephone 01274 236424

<h3><i class="fa fa-child"></i>  What if I'm struggling</h3>
You have two weeks from the start date of your course to make any decision about withdrawing from the programme.

After this point you will incur tuition fees.

If you are thinking of withdrawing please speak to your PAT tutor first, they may be able to help.

Don’t just stop attending and assume we will think you have withdrawn – you must complete a formal withdrawal form to stop fees being charged.

<h3><i class="fa fa-folder-open-o"></i>  Policies</h3>
