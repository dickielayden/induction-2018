<h3><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>  Student Representative</h3>
Our Student Representation system is an essential aspect of engagement and ensuring students can be active in their own experience. All students have the opportunity to put themselves forward to be a rep and there are many good reasons to do so:

* It is a democratic system in which: Your voice, your views, your concerns are represented through students at all levels of the University
* Representatives can take student views to various staff/student events and decision-making meetings, committees and boards. 
* It is a mechanism to improve the student experience at the University of Bradford
* It's also a volunteer experience that will develop your own leadership skills

**How to become a Representative**

If you are interested in becoming a Student Representative, please talk to your programme/module leader expressing your interest in standing for election. During October (or February for programmes that begin in January), elections will take place on all our programmes to select representatives for the academic year.
