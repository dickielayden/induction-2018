The Library is your secret weapon to greatness!

<a href="http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/15038/" target="_blank">This recent study</a> concluded that:

*"There is a statistically significant correlation ... between library activity data and student attainment"*

Becoming familiar with the Library as soon as possible is a really smart move.

<a href="library_induction/index.html" target="_blank"> This link will open up an induction presentation in a new browser tab.</a> You can navigate through the presentation with your cursor keys or by clicking the mouse.  You can close the tab when you have finished to return back here.

<h2><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Meet your librarian</h2>

In your induction week you will meet your subject librarian and will get to know the basics of using the library.  

If you are studying Health, Wellbeing and Social care your subject librarian is Maria Introwicz.

<h2><i class="fa fa-laptop"></i> PCs and laptops:</h2>
There are many PCs that you can use around campus.<a href="http://www.bradford.ac.uk/it-services/students/computers/computer-availability/
" target="_blank"> You can see which are available at any one time from this link </a>

The library has laptops that you can borrow. The floor 0 enquiry desk in the J B Priestley library will loan you a laptop for up to 24 hours, or you can borrow a laptop for up to 2 hours use in the library only from the self service machine. 

<h2><i class="fa fa-quote-right"></i> Referencing:</h2>
When you use resources within your work you need to acknowledge the original creator of the work that you are referring to. Referencing also helps back up the arguments you are making in your work and enable others to follow up your research. We are using the Harvard Referencing style. You will have a session with your librarian about referencing, but to get you started <a href=" http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/files/course/harvard-ref/index.htm" target="_blank">this link will open our referencing guide in a new window.</a>

<h2><i class="fa fa-shield"></i> Keeping safe â€“ making sure you avoid plagiarism:</h2>
Before you hand in your first assignment you will be asked to complete some materials about plagiarism. These materials will be available on blackboard from the start of your course.  Information about plagiarism is available from this link <a href=" http://www.bradford.ac.uk/library/help/plagiarism/
